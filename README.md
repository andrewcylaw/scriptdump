# scriptdump
A collection of scripts I've written over time, centralized to one common dumping ground.

## prboom-macro (03 September 2017)
A script that creates convenient runnable configs to run prboom. Either global or session specific configs are
loaded from an external .ini file, and supports custom tagging/identifiers.

## csv2tsv (16 September 2017)
Converts a .csv into a .tsv using an optionally given output name.

## merchos-scraper (18 August 2018)
MerchOS offers Grand Exchange flipping ideas for free. The UI is artificially limited to one batch of five "idea" items every five seconds - but the underlying network call is not rate limited.

This script scrapes these requests and prints it in a nicely formatted table.

## WASD-mediakeys (29 October 2019)
Configuration for AutoHotkey that adds the same media shortcut keys as a WASD V2 keyboard.
